1. This is a demonstration of guacozy - web based remote connection manager.

2. On the left we can see connections which are available to current user. Connection tree is searchable.

3. We can connect right away by using double click.

4. Or by using a context menu option.

5. Connection is opened in currently active tabset (next to currently active tab).

6. Tabs can be rearranged in many ways. Underlying connection is automatically resized to accommodate for new size.

7. When starting a session a ticket is created. Ticket has a default lifetime of 24 hours.

8. Ticket can be duplicated if you want to have more than one session to server.

9. When a ticket is deleted - it's tab is automatically closed.

10. When session is ended due to any reason, you are presented with a choice: to reconnect or close the tab. The ticket is not deleted if you close the tab. 

11. If you start a session, and a ticket in your name already exists for this connection - it is used automatically. 

12. A ticket can be shared. Let's share a ticket to Jane Doe.

13. Jane logs in and you can see that she has less connections available to her. John needs help with some server command even though he has access to more connections.

14. Ha ha ha ha.

15. Jane can see a ticket shared with her in the "Active tickets" section. She clicks and joins session to help out John.

16. Keyboard and mouse can be controlled by both parties. Session resolution is controlled only by original user.

17. <speak>Back to John.<break time="1s"/>  Folders can be created, <break time="4s"/>  renamed, <break time="4s"/>  or deleted. </speak>

18. Folders can not be deleted, if they have child folders or connections inside.

19. Folders and connections in tree can be rearranged.

20. After rearranging is finished, you have to save your changes.

21. John logs out, and administrator, logs in. 

22. Administrators and users, who have staff status, can access Administration area.

23. We can edit folder permissions by editing a folder. Let's give Jane access to Customers root folder, and revoke John's access. We can do it in the same step.

24. Jane can refresh connections by clicking refresh button.

25. <speak>We can view connections list <break time="2s"/> and we can create new connections.</speak>

26. <speak>Let's see ticket log. <break time="1s"/>. We can search, and use filters. <break time="4s"/> We can click values to filter by selected value. </speak>

27. Thank you for your attention.
